# Maze_solver
This Python project implements the A* algorithm to efficiently solve mazes. A* is a widely-used pathfinding algorithm known for its effectiveness in finding the shortest path between two points while considering obstacles. The code provides a clear implementation of A* and includes a graphical interface to visualize the maze-solving process. This repository serves as a practical demonstration of A* algorithm usage in solving maze navigation problems.
